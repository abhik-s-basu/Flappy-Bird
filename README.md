# Flappy-Bird

Adaptation of the popular game [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird) which was removed from all app stores because of being too addictive. Here is me hoping I have made an easy version of the same game :P
Additionally the game has two modes: the day mode and night mode which enable themselves according to the systems day and night time.
